<p>Pixal is a web interface that takes a YouTube URL as input, and outputs a genre classifier and an average-color-per-frame image. This is done using a combination of OpenCV color analysis and scikit-learn machine learning, and makes intelligent assumptions on our data to output a substantially accurate genre classification for the input video.</p>

<a id="related-work" class="anchor" href="#related-work" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Related Work</h3>
<p>Our motivation primarily comes from GitHub user Sacert's 'Colors of Film' analysis, in which he analyzed popular Hollywood films and extracted avereage frame colors. He used OpenCV and some built-in python libraries to generate his output, which is an image with colors from each frame of the movie. Below is the output image for Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban:</p>

<a id="initial-questions" class="anchor" href="#initial-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Questions</h3>
<p>When we began our analysis, the question we asked was, <i>"Can we accurately predict music genre by analyzing various aspects of a music video"</i>. This question was obviously extremely broad, and we quickly realized that we needed to narrow the scope and focus in on a few <b>important/relevant</b> features.</p>
<p>Thus, we revised our question to, "Can we accurately predict music genre by analyzing average frame color and youtube's video metadata (likes, dislikes, viewcount, etc.)". This question was much more manageable, but was more geared towards a final product than the actual data science process.</p>
